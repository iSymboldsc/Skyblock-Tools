# Skyblock Tools 🥔✌️

A collection of small tools (not more than 100 lines usually), I’m developing to make the SkyBlock **experience** better and more fun! All of them are CLI tools made for farming, combat stats, and other SkyBlock-specific tasks.

## Added Tools

### Calculators
#### Potatoer

Small CLI to make (mostly Ironman) hot potato books easier to calculate.

**Dependencies**: rich, questionary
